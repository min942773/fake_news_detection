2.  Fake news characterization<br>
2.1 Definitions of fake news<br>
- A narrow definition : new articles that are intentionally and verifiably false and could mislead readers; authenticity and intent are two key features.<br>
- Broader definitions : satire news (authenticity), deceptive news (intent)<br>
- In this article, we use the narrow definition<br>
2.2	Fake news on traditional news media<br>
- Psychological foundations of fake news.<br>
  - naïve realism : consumers tend to believe that their perceptions of reality are the only accurate views<br>
  - confirmation bias : consumers prefer to receive information that confirms their existing views.<br>
- Social foundations of the fake news ecosystem.<br>
  - preference for social acceptance and affirmation is essential to a person’s identity and self-esteem -> make users likely to choose “socially safe” options <br>
  - the utility for publisher<br>
    1. short-term utility : the incentive to maximize profit<br>
    2. long-term utility : their reputation in terms of news authenticity<br>
  - the utility of consumers<br>
    1. information utility : obtaining true and unbiased information<br>
    2. psychology utility : receiving news that satisfies their prior opinions and social needs<br>
2.3	Fake news on social media<br>
- Malicious accounts on social media for propaganda<br>
  - social bots, cyborg users, trolls.<br>


3. Fake news detection<br>
3.1 Problem definition<br>
- binary classification; 1 if it is a piece of fake news otherwise 0<br>
3.2 Feature extraction<br>
3.2.1 News content features<br>
- source, headline, body text, image/video<br>
- linguistic-based : exploit linguistic features that capture the different writing styles and sensational headlines to detect fake news<br>
- visual-based : faking-images<br>
3.2.2 Social context features<br>
- user-based : capturing users’ profile and characteristic; individual level & group level<br>
- post-based : focus on identifying useful information to infer the veracity of news from various aspects of relevant social media posts; post level, group level, temporal level<br>
- network-based : extracted via constructing specific networks among the users who published related social media posts; stance network, cooccurrence network, friendship network<br>
3.3 Model construction<br>
3.3.1 News content models<br>
- knowledge-based : use external sources to fact-check proposed claims in news content; expert-oriented, crowdsourcing-oriented, computational-oriented<br>
- style-based : detect fake news by capturing the manipulators in the writing style of news content; deception-oriented, objectivity-oriented<br>
3.3.2 Social context models<br>
- stance-based : utilize users’ view-points from relevant post contents<br>
- propagation-based : the interrelations of relevant social media posts<br>
<br>

4. Assessing detection efficacy<br>
4.1 Datasets<br>
- BuzzFeedNews, LIAR, BS Detector, CREDBANK<br>
4.2 Evaluation metrics<br>
- Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy<br>
- TPR, FPR, AUC<br>
5. Related areas<br>
- Rumor classification, Truth discovery, Clickbiat detection, Spammer and bot detection<br>
6. Open issues and future research<br>
7. Conclusion<br>
